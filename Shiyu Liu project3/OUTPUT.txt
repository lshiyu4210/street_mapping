The main method of this project is in StreetMapping.java. Please provide all the
arguments in its command line. 

For the first argument(args[0]), you have to provide the location of the test file. For
example: \Users\liusy\Desktop\ur.txt 

For the second argument(args[1]), you have to provide one of the following three instructions:
"-show", "-directions", or "-meridianmap". "-show" will only draw the graph. For example:
\Users\liusy\Desktop\ur.txt -show

"-directions" will draw the graph and has a red line representing the shortest path between 
two intersections. If the red path is not shown, please change the size of the window. You also 
have to provide the name of two intersections after it. For example: 
\Users\liusy\Desktop\ur.txt -directions i28 WILSON-BRIDGE

"-meridianmap" will draw the graph and has blue lines representing the minimum spanning
tree. Note that for nys.txt, it might take 30s to 40s to compute the MST, Similarly, if the blue
path is not shown, please change the size of the window. Example for the command line 
argument: \Users\liusy\Desktop\ur.txt -meridianmap

IMPORTANT: You CANNOT provide two instructions at the same time!
